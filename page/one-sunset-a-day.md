# one Sunset a Day

![Sunsets Poster](_i/sunsets.webp)

I am lucky enough to live on the shore of a salt lake in the South of France ([Balaruc les Bains](https://goo.gl/maps/xsAjJm6BoSe3TcXv9)). Over the last twenty years, I have taken pictures of extraordinary sunsets. Throughout 2022, I will be selling my most beautiful photos in NFT. One sunset a day.
