# Audio Book

In the middle of the covid crisis, [Geoff Burt](https://www.backstage.com/u/geoff-burt/) recorded the audio book of *Clean Hands Save Lives* because he wants people to know about the importance of hand hygiene to fight viruses and bacterias. [He opened a Youtube Channel to publish it freely in the spirit of the peace economy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zMMb5x16d4&ab_channel=CleanHandsSaveLivesTV)
