# Clean Hands Save Lives

[Downloads](geste_downloads.md)

You may not know it, but an innovation has made our world a better place. The use of alcohol-based handrubs protects us from infectious diseases and saves millions of lives each year through safer health care.

Here is the story of this revolutionary formulation, made available without patent and offered as a gift to humanity by Professor Didier Pittet and his team at Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève (HUG). From bush doctors to giant pharmaceutical corporations, everyone can now produce effective handrubs, cheaply and easily.

Didier Pittet’s medical odyssey has taken him to the four corners of the Earth. It also reveals a new path open to human society, one that promises a radical shift from a predatory economic system to an economy of peace.

“WHO is fortunate that Didier Pittet said “yes” when the call went out for his help. […] Much can be learned from the story that is told so well and so inspirationally in this book.” Dr. Margaret Chan, Director-General, World Health Organization

Thierry Crouzet — blogger, essay writer, and novelist — is fascinated by contemporary issues located at the nexus of technology, politics, and literature. A former journalist, his published works in French include Le Peuple des connecteurs* \[The Connected People], a premonitory reflection on our networked society; *J’ai débranché* \[How I Unplugged], a tale of digital burnout; *La Quatrième Théorie* \[The Fourth Theory], a political techno-thriller.
